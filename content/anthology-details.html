</div>
<div class="row space">
    <div class="col text-start fs-4">
        <p><b>Do I have to pay anything to be included?</b></p>
        <p>Absolutely not! Contributing authors will never be asked to pay for anything related to book production or
            advertisements.</p><br />
        <p><b>Can I purchase author copies?</b></p>
        <p>Yes! You may purchase up to 5 copies of the book at the publisher's price. Near publication, we will send a
            form to sign up for author copies. After receiving payment, we will send the copies you requested. This
            is completely optional, and the ONLY time we would ever request money from contributing authors.</p><br />
        <p><b>Will I be paid?</b></p>
        <p>Yes! All selected authors with stories between 10,000-25,000 words will receive a flat-rate payment of $50 +
            a physical copy of the finished book. Any stories under 10,000 words will not receive monetary payment, but
            will receive a physical copy of this finished book.
        </p><br />
        <p><b>Will the book be marketed?</b></p>
        <p>Yes! The marketing plan has not been finalized, but we plan to do various things to aid in the success of the
            book. While we would like contributing authors to be involved with marketing, it will only involve free
            methods. All paid advertisements will be covered by the publisher.</p><br />
        <p><b>Does my story need to be edited before I submit it?</b></p>
        <p>Authors are encouraged to submit the best version of their story, so self-editing is strongly advised.
            Twenty-Two Bloom is not responsible for any editorial services you received prior to submission or
            unrequested by the publisher.
        </p><br />
        <p><b>Can I submit a story with sex?</b></p>
        <p>The intended audience for the anthology is 18+ years old, so sex and other adult themes are allowed; however,
            we will not include any story that is considered erotica.</p><br />
        <p><b>Can I submit more than once?</b></p>
        <p>Yes, we will accept two submissions per author; however, we will only include one story per author in the
            anthology.</p><br />
        <p><b>Will you own rights to my story forever?</b></p>
        <p>Twenty-Two Bloom will have exclusive publishing rights to your story for one year following the date of
            publication. After that date, you may publish your story elsewhere. Please note, while we will no longer
            hold exclusive rights to your story, the anthology will still be available for purchase.</p><br />
        <p><b>Does the anthology have a title yet?</b></p>
        <p>No, the title will be chosen after stories have been selected. All suggestions are welcome!</p><br />
